/**
 *  @file cond.c
 *  @brief The implementation for condition variables.
 *
 *  To implement condition variables, we have an internal mutex that protects
 *  a queue. Threads waiting on a condition variable will enqueue all the
 *  information needed to awaken the thread in the cv's queue. One interesting
 *  problem we had while designing cond_wait is that there is a gap between
 *  the time we unlock the condition variable's mutex, thus allowing for other
 *  threads to signal the current thread, and the time we deschedule. We have
 *  to make this "atomic" otherwise our thread could sleep forever. In order
 *  to prevent a cond_signal from signally a about-to-sleep thread, we have
 *  a reject pointer that will essentially reject the deschedule if it is set
 *  due to another thread calling signal. Additionally, we found that some of
 *  the misbehave modes caused sleeping threads to run without a cond_signal
 *  so we wrapped this area in a while(!reject) so it can only awaken from a
 *  cond_signal.
